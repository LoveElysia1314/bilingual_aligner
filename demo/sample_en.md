# Chapter 3: Officer, It's This Person!

The next day, Masachika arrived at school about an hour earlier than usual.

It wasn't for any particularly important reason.

He simply woke up an hour earlier than usual.

And since Masachika rarely felt this refreshed upon waking, he anticipated that if he tried to go back to sleep, he'd end up tossing and turning, staying in bed until he overslept completely. So he decided to just head to school early.

Another reason was that today happened to be his day to be on duty.

At this school, two students are assigned as duty students each day, based on their attendance numbers, and their seats are arranged next to each other. In other words, Alya was Masachika's duty partner.

Masachika knew he was someone who disliked trouble and was lazy, but he made sure not to cause trouble for others (like forgetting his textbook and asking Alya to lend him hers—this didn't count as causing trouble in his mind).

So no matter how troublesome it was, he wouldn't slack off on his cleaning or duty responsibilities. Even so, he only did what was strictly his responsibility—this was just Masachika's natural personality—but today he felt different.

"Hmm, I did a perfect job."

Masachika looked around the empty classroom from the podium and nodded with satisfaction.

The desks and chairs were neatly arranged, and the class teacher's notebooks, ready to be returned, were neatly stacked on the desk.

The blackboard was completely free of chalk dust, and the eraser was spotless.

These were things Alya had done on her own initiative during her duty, which weren't originally part of the duty student's tasks. But since Masachika had gotten up unusually early today, he wanted to try saying to her, "Huh? You usually do this? I already finished it for you!"

Masachika returned to his seat, waiting for Alya, who should arrive earlier than usual.

A few minutes later, Alya indeed arrived. She opened the classroom door, spotted Masachika, and widened her eyes.

"Yo, good morning."

"...Good morning, Masachika-kun."

Alya surveyed the classroom, noticed that all the tasks she usually did had already been completed, and frowned. Masachika, wearing a smug smile, said to her:

"I got up incredibly early this morning, so I just did all sorts of chores while I had nothing else to do."

"...Masachika-kun actually got up early? Is it going to snow today?"

"Alya-chan, your Japanese is really good."

"Be careful not to fall asleep during class."

"...I'll handle it properly."

Masachika replied somewhat uncertainly, and Alya sighed in disbelief, softly but firmly saying:

"...I'll erase the blackboard this morning."

Masachika couldn't help but give a wry smile at this attitude of absolutely refusing to owe anyone a favor.

Masachika wasn't trying to do her a favor, but this seemed to be a matter of Alya's own pride.

After more than a year of interaction, Masachika knew that saying anything at times like these would be pointless, so he straightforwardly accepted her request, saying, "Then please do it."

In response to Masachika's reply, Alya once again nodded with a dissatisfied expression and walked toward her seat with somewhat strange steps.

Masachika thought this way of walking was odd and noticed that her knee-high socks were wet.

Looking out the window, he didn't even need to confirm—it was clearly sunny outside. Although it seemed to have rained last night, there was no sign of it now.

"What happened to your socks? Did you step into a puddle?"

"No, I didn't. I'm not you."

"Who are you calling a clumsy fool who's always absent-minded?"

"I didn't say anything that extreme... Sigh, they got splashed by a truck."

"Oh dear, that must have been tough for you."

"Anyway, it's also my fault for walking too close to the road. I have spare socks, so it's okay, right?"

Although she said this, as soon as Alya sat down, she uncomfortably scowled, took off her indoor shoes, bent her right leg and placed it on the edge of the chair, and began to take off her knee-high socks in front of Masachika.

A dazzling pair of legs, encased in white knee-high socks, were revealed before Masachika's eyes. Long, strikingly pale legs, bathed in the morning sunlight streaming through the window, glistened brilliantly. Her skirt slipped down from her straight legs, revealing a glimpse of her thighs beneath the hem.

After removing her soaked knee-high socks, Alya stretched out her legs as if immersed in a sense of liberation, letting her damp, bare right leg breathe. This sight made Masachika feel as though he had seen something he shouldn't have and quickly averted his gaze.

Even though she had merely taken off her knee-high socks, it evoked a strange sense of guilt, akin to peeking at someone changing clothes or taking a bath. Masachika now acutely realized that Alya was an exceptionally beautiful girl and suddenly felt restless.

"Hoo..."

Alya removed the knee-high socks from both legs, dried her legs with a small towel she carried for rainy days, and then let out a relieved sigh.

She casually glanced to the side and was surprised to see Masachika facing this way, wearing an awkward expression and looking downward.

Masachika, usually calm and unflappable, showing no reaction to anything, now wore a flushed, heart-pounding expression of embarrassment... Seeing this, Alya's lips curled into an uneasy, mischievous smile.

Alya, wearing an expression like someone about to play a prank, turned back toward Masachika, extended her right leg, and nimbly pinched the fabric of Masachika's pants between her big toe and index toe, pulling hard.

"Hey, could you please go to my locker and get my spare socks?"

"Huh?"

"I've already taken mine off, so I can't get them myself."

Then, as if hinting, "You'll understand when you see it," she lifted her toes into the air and neatly crossed her legs.

At that moment, Masachika almost caught a direct view of her absolute zone and couldn't hide his fluster, quickly averting his gaze.

Seeing his reaction, Alya's mischievous smile grew even more pronounced, and she rested her elbow on the back of the chair, propping up her chin.

Her silhouette, smiling happily against the morning sun, was picture-perfect.

It was just like a spoiled princess posing an unsolvable puzzle to her servant for amusement, or a villainous female boss making unreasonable demands of her subordinate.

(Whether it's a formal gown or a military uniform, Alya would look equally stunning in either~)

Masachika, letting his thoughts drift in completely unrelated directions, hurriedly stood up and headed toward Alya's locker at the back of the classroom.

After confirming with his gaze, he opened the locker and found it filled with neatly organized textbooks and toolboxes.

At the bottom, under a folded umbrella, were socks stored in a clear plastic bag.

Masachika once again inexplicably felt as though he was doing something he shouldn't, grabbed the socks along with the plastic bag, and hurried back to his seat.

"Here you go."

He handed the socks over, placing them beside Alya's face, and Alya, leaning against the window frame, dropped a bombshell.

"So, will you help me put them on?"

"What?"

Masachika let out a strange sound and turned around to see Alya raising her right leg toward him.

Perhaps because they were the only two in the classroom, Alya, unlike usual, showed no sign of hiding her amusement, tilting her head with a mischievous smile.

"What's wrong?"

"No, you're asking me what's wrong? I should be asking you what's wrong!"

"This is my thank-you for getting my socks for me. Isn't this a reward for you?"

"No, only a very special kind of person would consider something like this a reward..."

"Oh, isn't it?"

Alya, looking surprised, crossed her arms and once again neatly crossed her legs, causing Masachika to sharply turn his head, avert his gaze, and shout, "No! This is a reward~!"

Masachika had originally intended to continue, "That's enough! Please spare me!"... but before he could speak, Alya's softly spoken Russian words reached his ears.

【But it's the same for me too.】

He glanced sideways at Alya, and the mischievous expression from just moments ago had completely vanished.

Alya unconsciously blushed, played with her hair, and averted her gaze. Seeing this expression, Masachika's brain went into overdrive in a strange direction.

What was going on with Alya's behavior of covering herself with Russian?

Masachika had been pondering this question for a long time. Eventually, he concluded that "Alya might be a psychological exhibitionist."

Alya was a perfectionist and a hard worker. To become the ideal version of herself, she was always strict with herself and constantly striving.

However, the more one suppresses oneself in everyday life, the easier it is to find an outlet for the accumulated stress within. Masachika had heard this somewhere before.

And for Alya, this behavior of covering herself with Russian was precisely a way to release her stress.

Like an exhibitionist who appears in public without underwear, perhaps speaking embarrassing words in front of others was her way of enjoying the thrill of potentially being exposed.

That was Masachika's speculation. In other words, what he meant was...

(As long as it's consensual, it's fine!)

According to Masachika's theory, Alya was someone who enjoyed feeling shy. In other words, Alya would be happy, and he would be happy too. Yes, it was a win-win relationship!

......If others heard this, they'd surely respond with a barrage of吐槽 like, "What kind of logic is that?" "What's a psychological exhibitionist?" "Everyone who commits a crime claims it was consensual!" Sadly, there was no one in Masachika's brain to deliver those critiques.

But even at this stage, Masachika was still hesitating. Although it was consensual, it was established through Russian. At this point, he still hoped to obtain permission in Japanese.

"What did you just say?"

Based on this utterly wicked idea, Masachika turned back to face forward and asked again. Alya immediately responded with a provocative smile, masking her words in the very way Masachika had anticipated.

"Huh? I didn't say anything. I just called you a 'loser.'"

"That's exactly what I was waiting for!" Masachika cheered inwardly, pumping his fist and putting on a deeply regretful expression. Alya gave him a dismissive smile and uncrossed her legs.

"Oh, forget it. I'll just put them on myself—"

"No, that's not necessary."

"Huh...?"

Just as Alya was about to pull her socks back, Masachika knelt down right there, holding the socks, leaving Alya utterly astonished.

But the next instant, her right leg was gently supported by Masachika's hand, causing her eyes to widen dramatically.

"Ah!"

The sensation of someone's fingertips brushing from her heel to her ankle—a tingling, uncomfortable feeling—made Alya scream in surprise. Her right leg reflexively shot upward, and she quickly clutched at her skirt.

"Hey, hey, stop moving around!"

"Y-you're telling me not to move... Ah, wait—!"

On the verge of letting out a strange sound, Alya pressed her right hand against her skirt and swiftly covered her mouth with her left.

Masachika stared dumbfounded at Alya, a sly smile spreading across his lips as he said:

"What's wrong? Didn't you ask me to help you put them on?"

"Y-yes... but—!"

"Being called a loser—it still matters to my pride, after all."

"Wait, I'm not ready yet—"

But Masachika disregarded Alya's protest, using both thumbs to stretch open the sock's opening and gently pulling the sock onto Alya's foot.

The sensation of the sock creeping up from her toes felt like an electric current running up Alya's spine.

"Aah, don't—!"

Then, Masachika's thumb touched Alya's thigh through the thin fabric of the sock—

"Wh-where are you touching me?!"

"Agh!"

Alya's leg instinctively kicked upward, landing a perfect strike on Masachika's chin. Masachika fell backward, his head slamming hard into his chair.

"Ugh—!"

"Ah, I'm... I'm sorry. Are you okay?"

Watching Masachika lying on the floor, curled up and clutching his head in agony, Alya's concern ultimately overwhelmed her other emotions, momentarily forgetting her embarrassment and anger as she expressed her worry. Masachika, before her, trembled as he reached out his right hand toward the floor, his index finger tracing across it.

It was as if he were a dying patient writing his final message in his own blood.

In reality, Masachika's fingers weren't stained with blood; his fingertip merely brushed across the floor, yet Alya clearly saw the words Masachika intended to write.

Three simple characters: "pink."

"!"

The moment she recognized these three characters, Alya abruptly clutched at her skirt, her face instantly flushing red with anger and embarrassment.

"Ugh... you—ugh—!"

Not knowing how to vent her fury on the fallen Masachika, Alya repeatedly opened and closed her right hand, emitting inarticulate sounds for a moment, then quickly grabbed another sock from Masachika's desk and swiftly pulled it onto her left leg.

Once both feet were clad in indoor shoes, she shouted in Russian at Masachika, who was still lying motionless on the floor:

【I can't believe it! You idiot! Go die!】

After scolding Masachika like a child, Alya strode out of the classroom with rough steps. Just at that moment, two female classmates entering the classroom were startled by Alya's unusual appearance and quickly stepped aside.

"Huh? What? Did Princess Alya just scream so loudly?"

"That was Russian, wasn't it? What's going on? Huh? Has the princess lost her mind?"

The two exchanged shocked expressions as they watched Alya's retreating figure, then inadvertently glanced toward the classroom and spotted Masachika rubbing the back of his head.

"Good morning, Masachika... What happened?"

"Ah, good morning... No, nothing."

"Good morning, Masachika... What's wrong with your head?"

"Oh, it's nothing... Just feels like a pimple popped up here."

"Hmm...?"

The two tilted their heads in suspicion and sat down at their seats. Masachika pretended not to notice their questioning gazes, took out his phone, opened the messaging app, and sent a message to his younger sister.

"Sis, this is serious."

She was probably on her way to school by bus, and the message was immediately marked as read, with a reply coming back quickly.

"My dear brother, what's wrong?"

"Don't be scared when you hear this, but..."

"I'm all ears."

She sent back an animated sticker of a character shivering with fear. Masachika, looking at this intensely tense sticker, typed out a message with an expression of utter disgust.

"I... might be a leg fetishist."

"What are you saying...? Aren't you a die-hard boob person?"

"Yes... Ugh! Who would've thought I'd have such a fetish!"

"So that's how it is... It seems you've finally understood the beauty of legs..."

"Looks like it."

"Legs are amazing, aren't they? While plump thighs are wonderful, well-toned legs like an antelope's are also irresistible."

"Wow, sis, you're incredible."

"Hmm... By the way, bro."

"Hmm?"

"What kind of idiotic conversation is this?"

"Sorry."

Receiving a cold splash from his sister over the phone, Masachika's expression grew serious. He put away his phone and slumped lifelessly onto the desk.

"What am I going to do now..."

Masachika himself knew he'd gone too far in every respect just now. He felt it would be best to apologize right away, but Alya's pride was so strong that rushing to apologize now might only make her even more stubborn.

"Ah, let's think about it when she gets back."

Alya wasn't a child anymore. Once she calmed down, she might surprisingly return to her seat as usual.

◇

To state the conclusion first, it wasn't at all what Masachika had imagined.

"Um... Well, that's all the announcements for today. Oh, salutes are unnecessary, goodbye."

The homeroom teacher finished speaking quickly and hurried out of the classroom. Morning homeroom ended so swiftly that there were still nearly five minutes until the first class.

However, none of the students in Class 1-B left their seats; instead, some began quietly lowering their voices to whisper about something. The reason the teacher ended homeroom early and the students were somewhat tense was only one thing.

Because our Princess Alya had abandoned her usual poker face, resting her cheek on her hand and completely unleashing her displeased aura.

"Hey, tell me... What's going on over there?"

"I don't know... But I heard it has something to do with Masachika."

"That's right... Alya's in a terrible mood, so it must be Masachika who upset her. What exactly happened?"

"I just heard Alya screaming at the top of her lungs!"

"Huh? What did she say?"

"Heaven knows? She spoke Russian, so I couldn't understand."

Various speculations whispered softly throughout the classroom, and under these circumstances, Tsuyoshi quietly left his seat, bent over, and stealthily approached Masachika.

"Hey, tell me..."

"What's up?"

Intimidated by the atmosphere around him, Masachika unconsciously responded in a similarly hushed tone. Tsuyoshi then leaned close to Masachika's ear and whispered:

"I heard you got hit with a medulla oblongata kick after upsetting Alya. Is that true?"

"How did it come to this?"

Masachika couldn't help but exclaim, shrinking his neck under Alya's fierce glare.

By the way, a "medulla oblongata kick" is a spinning kick aimed at the back of the opponent's head. Even bad kids should never imitate this move.

"Alya wouldn't use such a dangerous move, would she?"

"I... I don't think so either."

"Yeah, at most she'd get a reverse hook kick to the jaw."

"Wait, isn't that dangerous in its own way?"

Tsuyoshi smiled wryly, thinking it was a joke, while Masachika thought, "But half of it's actually true," and gave a vague smile.

"So why is Princess Alya so upset?"

"Oh, it's just that..."

"You definitely did something wrong and caused trouble, didn't you? Now, confess already!"

"Ugh... Well, I guess I did do something wrong, didn't I?"

Honestly, he had done something wrong. He had caused trouble. But if he confessed now, "I touched her leg and saw her underwear," he'd obviously face an immediate year-level trial and unanimous approval for public execution.

So Masachika used his verbal skills to evade Tsuyoshi's persistent questioning, pondering how he could cheer Alya up.

"Ah... Alya?"

First things first—apologize. Masachika spoke to Alya, who was resting her chin on her hand and gazing out the window. Alya merely shifted her gaze toward Masachika and replied in a chilling tone:

"...What is it, Kuse-kun?" [You perverted leg fetishist.]

It felt as if he'd heard a subchannel. She'd added small Russian words next to "Kuse-kun."

Hearing this, Masachika wanted to shout his defense, but since he'd pretended not to understand Russian, he couldn't say much. After all, if he retorted, "Unfortunately, I'm a boob person," Masachika's stock in Alya's eyes would plummet to an all-time low, and every girl in the class would rush to dump their Masachika shares. In the end, silence was probably the right answer.

"But... when you think about it carefully, what I did wasn't really that serious, was it?"

Alya's cold response triggered this thought within Masachika.

After all, touching Alya's leg had originally been her own instruction, and it was she herself who kicked upward out of shyness. Seeing her underwear was an irresistible force, and reminding her afterward via a "last message" was probably unnecessary—but it was also a considerate hint that she didn't mind his rough resistance... Masachika just couldn't accept being the only one seen as at fault.

However, he knew that boys were often at a disadvantage in such situations, so he decided not to say anything rash and just apologize directly.

"Um... I'm sorry. I upset you in various ways just now."

"...I don't really mind, do I? After all, I was also at fault, and I've already gotten over being angry, haven't I?"

Masachika's inner question, "Then why do you look so unhappy~," overlapped with the classmates' inner thoughts after eavesdropping, "She's definitely lying..."

But actually, she wasn't lying. In fact, Alya had already gotten over her anger. What filled Alya's heart now was the shy feeling from having her leg touched and her underwear glimpsed.

Moreover, although it was because Masachika's reaction was so amusing, she was also embarrassed by her own proactive behavior of asking, "Could you help me put them on?"

And then there was her childlike shouting and screaming afterward—these actions further filled Alya's heart with shy feelings. If there were a hole in the ground, she'd want to crawl into it, seal the entrance for soundproofing, and then scream her heart out.

She deliberately projected an aura of "I'm in a bad mood!" outward only to hide what was really going on inside.

But Masachika couldn't fathom such a girl's heart and was simply at a loss.

The bell rang while he was hesitating, and the teacher entered the classroom to begin the first lesson.

"Alright—let's start class—so, duty student nine—Kuse, give the command!"

The math teacher checked the duty student's name written in the corner of the blackboard, casually glanced at Alya, and naturally called on Masachika.

(((I understand this feeling.)))

Everyone in the class, except for one person, shared the same sentiment.

"...Stand up, bow. Good morning, teacher~."

"Good morning, teacher~."

After exchanging greetings that had become unnaturally natural, the class continued in an inexplicably tense atmosphere.

For Masachika, the drawbacks of waking up early were indeed drawing sleep closer, but he wasn't brave enough to doze off in this atmosphere.

Even so, he couldn't concentrate on the lesson; instead, he was busy brainstorming ways to please the princess in his head.

"So, that's all for today... Kuse, give the command."

"...Stand up, bow. Thank you, teacher~."

"Thank you, teacher~."

The math teacher avoided looking at Alya until the very end and left the classroom. Masachika immediately rushed out of the classroom as if following closely behind, hurrying to the vending machine set up outside the emergency exit. After obtaining his target item, he immediately turned around and returned to the classroom, respectfully presenting it to Alya, his seatmate.

"Princess, please accept this today and spare this humble one."

What Masachika presented was... a product that had proudly held the top spot on the "Who Would Even Buy This at Seirei Academy" chart for fourteen consecutive years, called "Sweet Red Bean Soup." To elaborate, its contents could be described as liquid red bean paste—a drink so intensely sweet it left your mouth parched.

(((Why red bean soup?)))

The classmates looked at Masachika with expressions like, "Are you crazy? Are you provoking the princess?" But Masachika knew that Alya frequently drank this beverage that caused her blood sugar to spike.

"...Didn't I just say I wasn't angry?"

"Yes, you certainly did. This humble one hopes at least this can convey our sincere apology."

"...Alright, I'll take it."

"Thank you, Princess~."

As expected, Alya accepted the drink from Masachika, opened the can, and drank it all in one go. The entire class watched with trembling gazes.

"Thank you for the treat."

"Oh, I'll take care of the empty can."

"No need for something so trivial."

"No, no, no—this humble one can't possibly trouble the princess to do such a thing."

"Then stop putting on this strange act."

"Yes, sir."

Although her tone remained sharp, Masachika felt that Alya's aura had softened somewhat. He breathed a sigh of relief and returned to his seat... only to discover something serious.

"Oh no... I don't have the textbook for the next class."

In the past, he would have asked Alya to lend it to him. But if he brazenly said, "Can I borrow your textbook?" in this situation, Alya's slightly improved mood might plummet again.

And then the whole class would surely cast reproachful glances at him.

(There's no helping it...)

After stiffening up while checking his schoolbag and desk drawer, Masachika was met with Alya's puzzled gaze. As if trying to escape those eyes, Masachika turned his head and addressed the girl on the other side:

"Sorry, could I borrow your textbook?"

"Huh? Oh... um, sure."

The seatmate, as if guessing what was going on, gave a wry smile and readily agreed. Masachika was deeply grateful and, after pushing the desks together, breathed a sigh of relief without incident. And then...

【Playboy.】

With this whispered word in Russian, the classroom atmosphere grew even colder.

(What exactly do you want from me...?)

Masachika's sighs were futile, and the Year B classroom continued to maintain an inexplicably tense atmosphere throughout the day.
